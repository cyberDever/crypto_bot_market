*Raydium sniper bot*
It is a script or program that automatically monitors Raydium (a Solana-based decentralized exchange) for new liquidity pools or token listings and immediately buys tokens the moment they appear. It's often used in DeFi for getting in early on new tokens before they pump.

*Raydium volume bot*
It is an automated tool designed to simulate trading activity on the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX) by executing continuous buy and sell transactions. These bots are often used to increase the perceived trading volume of a token, which can enhance its visibility on platforms like DexScreener and attract potential investors.â€‹
